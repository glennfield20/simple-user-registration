#13 Signup Uniqueness Validation on Server.

- Signup with existing email & username. expect error 
  from network preview click error > detail.
- Enhanced validation to access database.
- change validateInput to commonValidations.
- Define high ordered functions validateInput(). Run this function as asynchronous functions.
- With 2 parameters data and otherValidations.
- Inside of it Deconstruct otherValidations.
- Inside of router.post call validateInput() pass req.body & commonValidations.
  append then to deconstruct the return. now move isValid conditions.

- Now we need to check if the username & email exists in the DB. There are 2 ways
- 1st we can make 2 query to the db seperately. or 1 query and the check the result.

- Instead of using 2 promises we gonna return only 1 promises.
- Using bookshelf we can query User. find record using where email and orWhere username
  then fetch then deconstruc user via then. inside of it,  if user found.
  set error for duplicate email & username. Use get to get the value of the field. 
  - error format 'There is user with such username | email'
- Below return the same object error and isValid. use isEmpty to check data has value.
